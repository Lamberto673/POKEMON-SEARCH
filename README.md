## 🕹️ How It Works
1. You type a Pokémon’s name into the input field.  
2. The app sends a request to PokéAPI’s `/pokemon/{name}` endpoint.  
3. If the Pokémon exists, its sprite, ID, weight, and abilities are displayed.  
4. If not, a friendly error message appears instead of breaking.  
5. Everything happens instantly in the browser — no backend needed.
